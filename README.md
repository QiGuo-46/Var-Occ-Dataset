# Var-Occ-Dataset
The **Var-Occ-Dataset** is a large-scale, diverse dataset specifically designed for **video de-occlusion tasks** in urban environments. It contains challenging scenarios with various types of occlusions, including static structures, dynamic objects, and dense coverage, to support research on robust scene recovery and reconstruction.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Structure

Each sequence includes:
- `frames/`: RGB frames of the video (with occlusions)
- `masks/`: Binary occlusion masks for each frame
- `info.json`: Metadata including occlusion type, motion type, frame rate, resolution, etc.
